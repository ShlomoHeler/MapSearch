# MapSearch

___
As someone who uses Google Maps a lot,
If I want to search for an address written on a web page,
It's pretty annoying to have to highlight the address, copy it, open a new tab, go into Google Maps, paste the address, and search...
So I built a simple plugin for quick search on Google Maps.

## How to use?

Just mark with the mouse the address we want, press the right key, and voila, we've added a new option:

Click on "search In Google Maps"
and a new tab opens with the location we chose, in Google Maps.
